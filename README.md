## Project Details
- **Title:** Sexual minorities experience greater sexual and singlehood satisfaction, but lower life satisfaction and greater loneliness: An exploratory study using multiverse analysis
- **Author:** Yutong Lu

## Abstract
- The study explores life satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, singlehood satisfaction, and loneliness levels among single individuals with different sexual orientations and gender identities.
- Data from baseline and follow-up surveys in 2022 were analyzed using a multiverse analysis approach with 128 models built for exploration.

## Method and Data Summary
- Data collected via online surveys included demographics like age, race, length of singlehood, sexual orientation, and gender.
- Analysis utilized multiverse analysis and cumulative link models and mixed models to assess satisfaction measures and their relationship with sexual orientation, gender, and other factors.

## Results
- Sexual minorities, particularly LGBQQ individuals, showed higher sexual and singlehood satisfaction but lower life satisfaction and increased loneliness compared to heterosexual individuals.
- Male individuals displayed lower life, sexual, and singlehood satisfaction but reported feeling less lonely compared to females.
- Interaction effects between male gender and sexual orientation had varied significance and directions across different satisfaction measures.

## Discussion
- The study revealed consistent effects for significant predictors within models but varying effects across different models, emphasizing the complexity of satisfaction measures among sexual minorities and genders.
- Length of singlehood emerged as a significant factor affecting life and sexual satisfaction consistently across different models.

## Conclusion
- The research highlights disparities in satisfaction levels among sexual minorities and genders.
- Compared to heterosexuals, LGBQQ persons appeared to have higher sexual and singlehood satisfaction, but lower life satisfaction and increased loneliness.
- Males, on the other hand, appeared to be less content with their life, sex life, and singlehood, but experienced less loneliness.
- The interaction between gender and sexual orientation impacted satisfaction measures, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.

## Limitations and Future Directions
- The study lacks certain demographic information and acknowledges the limitations of Likert scale responses, sample size in sexual minority groups, and assumptions made due to data collection.
- Future research could delve deeper into the intricacies of singlehood, satisfaction measures, and their relationship with demographic factors for a more comprehensive understanding.
